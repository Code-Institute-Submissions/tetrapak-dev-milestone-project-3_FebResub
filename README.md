## UX

### User Stories
My goal was to create a website with a vibe that is appealing to the reader and with an intuitive design that presents the books, the sign up and log in forms, and the profile functionality in a clear manner.
My second goal was to create a website that is available wherever the user is and that works smoothly in all devices, so that they can have their personal book list available whenever they need it.

#### First Time User Goals
- As a first time user I want to be able to easily understand what services you provide.
- As a first time user I want to be able to easily understand what the membership is about.
- As a first time user I want to know tha site easily accessible, especially if I'm going to sign up.

#### Returning User Goals
- As an account holder I want to be able to update my profile when I need to.
- As an account holder I want to be able to interact with the community.
- As an account holder I want to know your website is reliable on all devices I might use.

### Wireframes
For this project I made wireframes for five webpages within the website, namely

- The Home Page
- A page to view a single book in a large mode.
- A register page
- A login page
- And the profile  page

Each of the pages has three wireframes

- One for small screens
- One for medium screens
- One for large screens

The home page lists all books on the website while the second page focuses on the synopsis of each book.
The signup and login pages basically just contain simple forms for a clean design. Finally the profile page shows each account holders personal book list.

The wireframes were created using - [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/).

### Structure
The structure of the website is laid out in such a way that the books have the main focus only a nav bar at the top for navigation though the website. 
The home page displays all books and if you create an account you get your personal book list that you can edit. 
The difference between viewing the website publically and being a member is that the member can create and edit their personal book list and also leave reviews. A non-member can only view the whole library of books without being able to edit it.
